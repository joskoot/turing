@section{Introduction}
Procedure @rack[make-TM] returns procedures that emulate two-way single tape
@hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" "Turing Machines"].
The reader is supposed to be familiar with the subject.
Nevertheless a short introduction with the details of the type of emulated Turing machines.

@elemtag["book" ""]
@note{John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman provide a comprehensive description
of Turing Machines in their book:
"Formal Languages and their Relation to Automata (ISBN 0-201-0298 3-9)".}

@elemtag["figure" ""]@inset{@larger{@bold{Turing machine variant as used in this document}}}

@inset[@image["make-TM.jpg"]]

A Turing machine consists of a control unit, a tape, a tape-head
and a bidirectional data-bus between the control unit and the tape-head.
At every moment the control unit has one out of a finite set of internal states.
The tape-content consists of a finite number of cells, but can stepwise grow in both directions
to arbitrary size.
Each cell contains one of a finite set of tape-symbols.
There are two special tape-symbols, the @elemref["space" "space"] and the empty-mark.
A cell containing the empty-mark is called an `empty cell'.
The tape never has more than one empty cell.
If it has one, it is the first or the last one and it is the current one.
The state of a Turing machine as a whole includes
the internal state of the control unit,
the current content of the tape and
the current position of the tape-head.
The first cell of the tape-content is considered to be at the left,
the last one to be at the right.
In the @elemref["figure" "figure"] they are blue.
The current cell (red) is the one below the tape-head and
contains the current tape-symbol.
The Turing machine must be given an input for the initial tape-content.
The input must be a finite list of tape-symbols but must not contain an empty-mark.
The machine starts with a given initial internal state for the control unit
and with the tape-head positioned at the leftmost cell of the initial tape-content.
If the input is not empty, the initial tape-content has no empty cell.
If the input is empty, the initial tape-content consists of one single empty cell.

@note{In @elemref["book" "the book mentioned above"] the empty-mark is called a `blank'.
In order to avoid confusion with the word `space'
as introduced @elemref["space" "below"],
the word `blank' is avoided in this document.}

The control unit makes moves according to a program consisting of a finite set of rules.
The machine halts as soon as the control unit assumes a final state,
or runs forever if it never reaches a final state.
The rule to be applied is determined by the current tape-symbol of the tape
and the current internal state of the control unit.
Possibly only part of the internal state is used for the choice of the rule.
A move consists of three steps:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          
@item{Optionally writing a new tape-symbol in the current cell.
This step is not optional when the current cell is empty.
An empty cell always is filled with a tape-symbol other than the empty-mark.
When the control unit sends an empty-mark to the tape-head for writing,
the tape-head in fact writes a @elemref["space" "space"].
Writing a tape-symbol does not affect the content of the tape at the left or the right
of the tape-head.}

@item{Optionally moving the tape-head one cell to the right or to the left.
When the tape-head moves left of the start of the tape-content or right of the end,
an empty cell is added. This cell becomes the current one.
In this way a tape is simulated with an infinite number of
empty cells both at the left and at the right of the actual content.}

@item{Optionally putting the control unit in another internal state.}]

@note{In real life tape equipment usually the tape is moving
while the tape-head remains in fixed position.
Moving the tape in opposit direction with the tape-head in fixed position has the same effect.}

@note{Magnetic tape equipment of the old days (sixties and seventies) usually destroyed all data 
following the newly written data,
although with some effort part of it could be recovered.
This equipment was not designed for replacement of part of the data in the middle of a file.
The tape of a Turing machine does not have this problem.}

@elemtag["space" ""]The machine cannot remove cells from the tape,
but it can replace the current tape-symbol by a space, which is a tape-symbol.

Let's start with a simple example of a Turing machine.
Its states are the initial state @rack['A], the intermediate states @rack['B], @rack['C] and
@rack['D] and the final state @rack['T].
In the rules @rack['R] indicates a move of the tape-head one step to the right.
@rack['N] indicates that no move must be made.
None of the rules prescribe a move to the left (which would be indicated by @rack['L]).
@rack['_] is the dummy, which is not a tape-symbol.
In this example a rule has the form:

@rack[((old-state old-tape-symbol-or-dummy) (new-state new-tape-symbol-or-dummy) move)]

A rule applies when its @rack[old-state]
equals the current state of the control unit
and the @rack[old-tape-symbol-or-dummy] equals the current tape-symbol read from the tape.
When the @rack[old-tape-symbol-or-dummy] is the dummy
it matches every arbitrary tape-symbol.
A rule whose @rack[new-tape-symbol-or-dummy] is a tape-symbol indicates that the content
of the current cell must be replaced by this tape-symbol.
However, when the tape-head receives an empty-mark for writing,
it in fact writes a @elemref["space" "space"].
A rule whose @rack[new-tape-symbol-or-dummy] is the dummy indicates that the content
of the current cell must not be altered,
except that if it is empty,
it is filled with a @elemref["space" "space"].
The machine accepts every input and replaces the fourth element by @rack['new].

@interaction[
(require racket "make-TM.rkt")

The returned values are the number of moves made, the final state and
the modified content of the tape.
Let's see more details in a report of the moves.
In such a report the new content of the tape is shown as
@tt{((head ...) (current tail ...))} representing the content
@tt{(head ... current tail ...)} where @tt{current} is the current tape-symbol.
The following machine replaces the second and the fourth tape-symbol.

@larger{@bold{Additional registers}}@(linebreak)
Every Turing machine emulated by a procedure made by @rack[make-TM]
has at least two registers for its internal state.
The first register is the rule-selector-register and the second one the input/output-register,
but the control unit may have more registers.
The input/output-register is used for exchange of data with the tape-head via the data-bus.
At the start of a move, the tape-head reads the current tape-symbol and sends it
via the data-bus to control unit, which places it in the input/output-register.
Subsequently the rule to be applied is determined by the combination of the
rule-selector-register and the current tape-symbol in the input/output-register.
During a move new values can be put into the registers, possibly obtained from other registers.
After all registers have been updated,
the content of the input/output-register is sent via the data-bus to the tape-head
in order to be written onto the tape and to replace the current tape-symbol.
However, if the tape-head receives an empty-mark, it writes a @elemref["space" "space"].
Finally the tape-head may be moved one step to the right or to the left.
A Turing machine repeats moves until the first register contains a final state.

A Turing machine with more than two registers
is equivalent to a Turing machine with only two registers
as long as the combined contents of the registers is limited to a finite set.
Allowing more registers is a way to simplify the description of the rules.
It allows us to describe a finite multitude of rules in one single line.
For example, multiple registers make it easier to describe rules that move part of the content
of the tape to another position on the tape. Section @secref["More registers"] shows an example.

Procedure @rack[make-TM] returns a procedure that emulates a Turing machine.
Providing an @racketlink[exact-positive-integer? "exact positive integer"] @tt{n}
for @rack[registers] is the same as providing
@nonbreaking{@rack['(#:0 #:1 ... #:n-1)]}.
The first @rack[register-name] is for the rule-selector-register and the second one
for the input/output-register.
Before the machine is produced the arguments are checked to satisfy all contracts
and the following conditions,
equality or being distinct to be understood in the sense of @rack[equal?].

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
 @item{The @rack[space], the @rack[empty-mark] and the @rack[dummy] must be distinct.}
 @item{The @rack[final-states] must not include an @rack[old-state].}
 @item{The @rack[final-states] must not contain duplicates.                       }
 @item{The @rack[rules] must have distinct combinations @rack[(old-state old-symbol)].}
 @item{Let n be the number of @rack[register-names].
       Every @rack[rule] must have n@tt{-}2 @rack[register]s.}
 @item{The list of @rack[register-name]s must not contain duplicates.}
 @item{Every @rack[register] given as a keyword in a @rack[rule]
       must be one of the @rack[register-name]s.}]

When not all of these conditions are satisfied,
procedure @rack[make-TM] raises an @rack[error].

@section{Running a Turing machine}
The control unit interprets the @rack[rules] as follows,
equality again to be understood in the sense of @rack[equal?].
The first one of the @rack[registers] will be referred to as the rule-selector-state-register
and its contents as the current rule-selector-state.
The second one of the @rack[registers] is the input/output-register.
It contains the @rack[tape-symbol] read from or to be written onto
the current cell under the tape-head.

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{A Turing machine halts when the rule-selector-state equals one of the @rack[final-states].}

@item{A @rack[rule] applies if its @rack[old-state] equals the current rule-selector-state
and the @rack[old-symbol] matches the current tape-symbol.}

@item{The @rack[dummy] matches every current tape-symbol.
Every other @rack[old-symbol] matches only when equal to the current tape-symbol.}

@item{A @rack[rule] whose @rack[old-symbol] equals the current tape-symbol
prevails over a @rack[rule] with the same @rack[old-state] and
whose @rack[old-symbol] is the @rack[dummy].
For @rack[rules] with the same @rack[old-state] the @rack[dummy]
is like @rack[else] in a @rack[cond]-form,
but is not required to be at the end.
The order of the @rack[rules] is irrelevant.}

@item{The first step of a move is putting the current tape-symbol in the input/output-register.}

@item{The second step is looking for a matching @rack[rule].
      When no matching @rack[rule] can be found, the procedure halts by raising an error.}

@item{The third step updates the @rack[registers].
      Element k of the third element indicates what to put in @rack[register] k.
      Let x be element k of the third element of the applied rule.
      If x is the @rack[dummy] register k remains unaffected.
      If x is a @rack[state] or a @rack[tape-symbol],
      this state or tape-symbol is put in register k.
      If x is a @rack[register-name] the old content of that register is put in register k.
For example, @rack[(#:1 #:0)] indicates that the two registers exchange their contents.
As another example:
@rack[(#:1 whatever)] means that the old contents of register @rack[#:1] must be put into
register @rack[#:0] and that @rack['whatever] must be put in register @rack[#:1].}

@item{Now the @rack[tape-symbol] of the input/output-register is written on the tape,
replacing the current tape-symbol.
However, if the input/output-register contains an @rack[empty-mark] a @rack[space] is written.}

@item{Finally the tape-head may be moved:@(linebreak)
@rack[move] @rack['L] : move the tape-head one step to the left.@(linebreak)
@rack[move] @rack['R] : move the tape-head one step to the right.@(linebreak)
@rack[move] @rack['N] : don't move the tape-head.@(linebreak)
When the tape-head leaves the current content of the tape,
an empty cell is added and the tape-head is positioned at this cell.}

@item{The above process is repeated until the rule-selector-state equals a @rack[final-state].}]

Notice that the set of @rack[state]s and the set of @rack[tape-symbol]s are not required to be
disjoint. The same Racket-object can be used for both a @rack[state] and a @rack[tape-symbol].
The state-selector-register can receive a tape-symbol for its new state.
The input/output-register can receive a state for its new tape-symbol.
This is not contrary to the formal definition of Turing machines.
(See @elemref["book" "John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman"]
who do not require set K and set Œì to be disjoint.)
If disjunction between the sets is desired, the rules can be given such as to accomplish this,
simply by making a distinction between registers that can contain a state and those
that can contain a tape-symbol.
A procedure returned by procedure @rack[make-TM],
say @(bold (elment 'tt (bold "Turing-machine"))),
can be called as follows:

@defproc[#:link-target? #f
(Turing-machine
 (input (and/c (listof tape-symbol) (not/c (member empty-mark input))))
 (#:registers regs (or/c (listof (or/c tape-symbol state)) #f) #f)
 (#:report report (or/c boolean? 'long 'short) #f)
 (#:limit limit (or/c exact-positive-integer? #f) #f))
(values (nr-of-moves exact-nonnegative-integer?)
        final-state
        (output (listof tape-symbol)))]{
The @rack[output] is the final content of the tape but without heading or trailing
@rack[empty-mark] or @rack[space]s.
It can contain @rack[space]s, but not at the begin nor at the end.

@note{In the formal definition of a Turing machine there is a finite set of @rack[tape-symbol]s.
The machines returned by procedure @rack[make-TM] may,
but do not necessarily limit the input to a predefined set of @rack[tape-symbol]s.
They can use the union of the set of
@rack[tape-symbol]s in the @rack[input] and those
that can be extracted from the arguments given to procedure @rack[make-TM].
This means that formally, procedure @rack[make-TM]
does not return a completely defined Turing machine.
The definition is completed by the @rack[input] at the moment
the procedure that emulates the machine is called.
At that moment we have a running procedure that emulates
a Turing machine according to the formal definition.}

If @rack[regs] is @rack[#f] all @rack[registers] are initialized with the
@rack[empty-mark], the state-selector-register excepted, which is initialized with the
@rack[initial-state]. Otherwise it must be a list of as many @rack[state]s and/or
@rack[tape-symbol]s
as the Turing machine has @rack[registers] and the @rack[regs] provide the initial values.

If @rack[report] is @rack[#t] or @rack['long] the Turing machine
prints a long record of the moves it makes (on the @racket[current-output-port])
For each move the report shows:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{The move counter, starting from 1.}
@item{The @rack[rule] being applied.}
@item{The original and new contents of the @rack[registers],
      the original contents of the input/output-register already showing the tape-symbol
      just read from the tape.}
@item{The @rack[move] of the tape-head (@rack['R], @rack['L] or @rack['N]).}
@item{The new position of the tape-head and the new content of the tape shown as
@nonbreaking{@tt{((h ...) (c t ...))}},
where the new position of the tape-head is at tape-symbol @tt{c}.}]

If @rack[report] is @rack['short] the Turing machine
prints a short record of the moves it makes (on the @racket[current-output-port])
For each move the report shows the move-counter
the old and new rule-selector-state and the new content of the tape.
If @rack[report] is @rack[#f], no report is written.

When @rack[limit] is an @racketlink[exact-positive-integer? "exact positive integer"]
the @tt{Turing-machine} halts by raising an error
when no @rack[final-state] is encountered within @rack[limit] moves.
                                                 
@section{Halting problem}
Many Turing machines never halt.
Sometimes this can be predicted by looking at the @rack[rules] only,
sometimes by inspection of both the @rack[rules] and the @rack[input].
However, because of the
@hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"]{Halting Problem}
there always remain cases for which it is impossible to detect an infinite loop.
Procedure @rack[make-TM] and the
Turing machines
it produces do no checks at all against infinite loops.
Whether or not a Turing machine halts may depend on its input.
Argument @rack[limit] provides protection.
The following trivial Turing machine
clearly would loop forever with arbitrary input when it would not be halted by
the @rack[limit]:

@interaction[
(require racket "make-TM.rkt")
(define TM (make-TM
            'A   (code:comment "initial state")
            '()  (code:comment "no final states")
            'E   (code:comment "empty-mark")
            'S   (code:comment "space")
            '_   (code:comment "dummy")
            '(((A _) (A _) N))
            #:name 'Non-halting-TM))
(TM '(S) #:report 'short #:limit 5)]

In this example @rack[rule] @rack['(((A _) N (A _)))] alone already implies an infinite loop.
While the @rack[TM] is running,
its state (the content of the tape and the position of the tape-head included)
never changes,
which could be detected while the @rack[TM] is running.
However, @rack[TM] does no such check.
As another example consider:

@interaction[
(require racket "make-TM.rkt")
(define TM (make-TM
            'A     (code:comment "initial state")
            '()    (code:comment "no final state")
            'E     (code:comment "empty-mark")
            'S     (code:comment "space")
            '_     (code:comment "dummy")
            '(((A _) (A S) R))
            #:name 'Another-non-halting-TM))
(code:line)
(TM '(whatever) #:report 'short #:limit 5)]

By means of mathematical induction it is easily proven that the above machine never halts,
although it never reproduces the same state.

@note{Procedure @rack[make-TM] could be adapted such as to
predict the infinite loops of the last two examples just by checking the rules.
It also could be adapted such as to produce
Turing machines that can detect a repeated state of the machine as a whole.
These adaptations have not been made,
for the Halting Problem implies that there always remain cases
in which a non-halting case cannot be predicted
by procedure @rack[make-TM] and cannot be detected while a
Turing machine with given @rack[input] is running.}}}]

@section{Examples}

Some of the examples are inspired by material of Jay McCarthy
that can be found in @hyperlink["http://jeapostrophe.github.io/2013-10-29-tmadd-post.html"
                                "http://jeapostrophe.github.io/2013-10-29-tmadd-post.html"].

In all examples @rack['E] is the empty element, @rack['S] the space and @rack['_] the dummy.
@rack['T] is the final state for an accepted input, @rack['F] for a rejected input.

@subsection{Erase elements}
The following Turing machine always halts.
A correct input is @tt["(x ... [+ x ...] ...)"],
where the square brackets indicate an optional part of the input.
The result of a correct input is the input without @tt["+"].
This is like addition of zero, one or more natural numbers,
where natural number n is written as `@tt["x ..."]' with n @tt["x"]s.
The machine never moves left of the start of the input.

@subsection{Binary addition}
The following Turing machine adds two natural numbers written in binary notation.
The machine halts with every arbitrary input.
A correct input is defined as follows:

@inset{@verbatim[
"input   = (operand + operand)
operand = bit ...+
bit     = 0 | 1"]}

An incorrect input yields @itel{final-state} @elment['tt "F"].
A correct input yields @itel{final-state} @elment['tt "T"] and @tt{output}
@nonbreaking{@rack[(bit bit ...)]}
showing the sum of the two operands.
More precisely the @tt{output} is @nonbreaking{@rack[(1 bit ...)]} or @rack[(0)],
id est, without leading zeros.
The initial content of the tape is modified such as to result in the sum.
In the sum a 0 bit is written as @elment['tt "x"] and a 1 bit as @elment['tt "y"]
such as to know which bits already have been established and which ones yet have to be computed.
During the addition the content of the tape is (ignoring spaces and empty-mark) 
@nonbreaking{@elment['tt "(0-or-1 ... x-or-y ... + 0-or-1 ...)"]}.
Bits of the second operand are processed starting from the least significant one.
Every such bit is replaced by a @itel["space"] before it is processed.
The significance of this bit is the same as that of
the right-most bit @nonbreaking{@elment['tt "0-or-1"]} of the first operand.
After all bits of the second operand have been processed,
the @elment['tt "+"] is removed,
elements @elment['tt "x"] and @elment['tt "y"] are reverted to
@elment['tt "0"] and @elment['tt "1"] and leading zeros are removed.

@subsection{Decimal addition}
The following machine expects @nonbreaking{@elment['tt "((n m) ...)"]} as input,
where each @elment['tt "n"] and each @elment['tt "m"] is a decimal digit coded as
an exact integer between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive).
The machine adds the numbers @elment['tt "n..."] and @elment['tt "m..."] and returns the sum
@elment['tt "s..."]
However the machine considers the first digit as the least significant one and
The machine passes first goes to the end of the input.
Subsequntly it does the adddition in one pass to the left.
Redundant trailing zeros are not removed.
It replaces each @itel{tape-symbol} @nonbreaking{@elment['tt "(n m)"]} by one decimal digit.
State @elment['tt "0"] indicates that there is no carry.
State @elment['tt "1"] indicates that a carry must be added.
State @elment['tt "A"] is the initial internal state and @elment['tt "T"] the final state.

The Turing machine program shown here takes 2 moves less than the one shown in

Another interesting point is, that the one shown here never writes a @rack[0].

@subsection{Zeros and ones}

The following Turing machine halts on every arbitrary input.
If the input is a list of zeros and ones with as many zeros as ones,
the @itel{final-state} is @rack['T].
In all other cases the @itel{final-state} is @rack['F].
The machine accepts an empty input immediately.
If the input is not empty, a starting mark @rack['s] is added at the left,
the input is checked to consist of zeros and ones only
and an ending mark @rack['E] is added at the end of the input.
Now the tape-head is at the element immediately left of the end mark @rack['E].
The following process is repeated until halted.
Starting from the right, the machine looks at the left for a @rack[0] or a @rack[1].
If a @rack[0] is encountered, it is replaced by @rack['E] and a required @rack[1] is looked for.
If a @rack[1] is encountered, it is replaced by @rack['E] and a required @rack[0] is looked for.
After finding a required @rack[0] or @rack[1], it is replaced by @rack['S],
the tape-head is positioned at the right of the tape
and the process is repeated until no more ones or zeros are present.
If a required @rack[0] or @rack[1] is not found, the machine halts with state @rack['F].

@subsection{Checking parentheses}

The following machine reads @rack['<] as a left parenthesis
an @rack['>] as a right parenthesis.
The machine halts in state @rack[T] if the parentheses are well balanced
and no other elements occur in the @itel{input}.
In all other cases the machine halts in state @rack[F].
When counting a @rack['<] as @elment['tt "+1"] and an @rack['>] as @elment['tt "-1"],
going from left to right the addition never must go below zero and must end in zero.
The method used in the following example does not need a counter. It is as follows.
First check that the input consists of @rack['<] and @rack['>] only.
Put @itel{tape-symbol} @rack[s] at the left of the input
and @itel{tape-symbol} @rack[e] at the right.
This helps detecting the start and the end of the current content of the tape.
Starting from the right go left looking for a @rack['>]
whose first preceding non-space element is @rack['<].
When found replace the @rack['<] and the @rack['>]
by spaces, go to the right of the input and repeat.
When looking for a @rack['>] all elements appear to be spaces, the machine halts in state @rack[T].
When encountering a @rack['<] before encountering a @rack['>] the parentheses are not balanced
and the machine halts in state @rack[F].

@subsection[#:tag "Inserting elements"]{Inserting elements}

The following Turing machine always halts.
For an input consisting of @rack['a]s and @rack['b]s only
the @itel{final-state} is @rack['T] and symbol @rack['x] is inserted
between each @rack['a] and an immediately following @rack['b].
The insertion of @rack['x] requires that the elements
preceding the @rack['b] are shifted one element to the left.
An input containing anything other than @rack['a] or @rack['b]
yields @itel{final-state} @rack['F].
@rack[0] is the initial state.

@subsection{Counter}

Represent natural number n as @tt{x ...} or @tt{y ...} with n @tt{x}s or @tt{y}s.
The following Turing machine never halts.
Given empty input it forms an infinite tape containing the numbers 0, 1, 2 etc.
separated by slashes.
Every next number is formed by putting an @tt{x} at the end of the content
and copying the previous number, which has the form @tt{x ...}.
While copying, the @tt{x}s of the previous number are replaced by @tt{y}s
such as to indicate they already have been copied.

The following counter is like the previous one,
but writes its numbers in binary notation and in reversed order,
every new one at the left of the previous one.
Bits 0 and 1 are used, but the last number consists of bits o for 0 and i for 1.
Bits o and i indicate that they have not yet been copied.
Every next number is formed by copying the the most recent one
while converting o and i of the original to 0 and 1.
i is added to the copy before the next number is generated.

@subsection[#:tag "More registers"]{More registers}
The Turing machines shown sofar in this document have one data-register and
one state-register only.
Let us use a Turing machine with two data-registers to simplify and to speed up
the example of section @secref{Inserting elements}.
One extra data-register is used.
It memorizes the previously replaced element when shifting tape-elements to the left
in order to make space for an x.
