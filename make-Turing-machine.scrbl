@section{Introduction}
This document describes a tool allowing the construction of procedures that emulate Turing-machines.
The reader is supposed to be familiar with Turing-machines.
The combination of the current content of the tape and
the current position of the read/write-head is
represented by two lists: @rack[head] and @rack[tail].
The content of the represented tape is

@inset[@rack[(append head tail)]]

The @rack[tail] never is empty.
Its first element marks the current position of the read/write-head.
The elements of the content are @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}s,
but the first or last element can be an @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]},
which is not a @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}.
Initially the @rack[head] is empty and the @rack[tail] is the @italic{@element['tt "input"]}.
If the @italic{@element['tt "input"]} is empty,
the @rack[tail] initially consists of one @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}.
The finite control unit makes moves according to a list of @italic{@element['tt "rule"]}s.
A move is determined by the current @italic{@element['tt "state"]} of the finite control unit
and the element currently under the read/write-head.
A move consists of three steps:

@itemlist[
@item{Optionally putting the control unit in another @italic{@element['tt "state"]}.}
@item{Optionally replacing the @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]} under the read/write-head by
another one. This step is not optional when
the read/write-head is positioned at an @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]},
which always is replaced by a @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}.
A visited @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]} never remains empty when the machine has not yet
reached a @italic{@element['tt "final-state"]}.}
@item{Optionally moving the read/write-head one step to the right or to the left.
We consider the first element of the content of the tape to be at the left and the last element
to be at the right.}]

@note{In real life tape equipment usually the tape is moving
while the read/write-head remains in fixed position.
Moving the read/write-head has the same effect as keeping it in fixed position and moving
the tape in opposit direction.}

@note{The state of a Turing-machine as a whole usually is defined such as to include
the internal @italic{@element['tt "state"]} of the control unit,
the current position of the read/write-head and the current content of the tape.
In this document the @italic{@element['tt "state"]} refers to the internal
@italic{@element['tt "state"]} of the control unit only and
does not include the current content of the tape nor the current position of the read/write-head.
This note excepted, this document does not refer to the state of a Turing-machine as a whole.
The internal state always is written as `@italic{@element['tt "state"]}'.
When changing the internal @italic{@element['tt "state"]} the words
`@italic{@element['tt "old-state"]}' and `@italic{@element['tt "new-state"]}' are used.}

The machine refuses to write @italic{@element['tt "dummy"]}s
nor can it erase a @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}
such as to produce an @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}.
It can write a @italic{@element['tt "blank"]},
which is a @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]} too.
@italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}s are used only to extend the tape
at the left or at the right of the current content.
When moving the read/write-head at the left of the begin of the content of the tape
or at the right of the end, an @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]} is added and
the read/write-head is positioned at this @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}.
In this way an infinite tape is simulated with an infinite number of
@italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}s both at the left and at the right of the actual content.
In fact the content never has more than one @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}. If it has one,
it is the first element or the last one and the read/write-head is positioned at it.
In this situation either the @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]} is immediately replaced by a
@italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]} during the next move or,
when the current move produces a @italic{@element['tt "final-state"]},
the machine immediately halts without replacing the @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}.
The @italic{@element['tt "dummy"]} is for use in @italic{@element['tt "rules"]} only.
The @italic{@element['tt "rules"]} describe how the control unit makes its moves.
The machine repeats moves until a @italic{@element['tt "final-state"]} is obtained,
or remains making moves forever if it never reaches a @italic{@element['tt "final-state"]}.
It is possible to put a maximum to the number of moves.
See parameter @rack[Turing-limit].
It may happen that there is no @italic{@element['tt "rule"]} specifying which move to make
with the current @rack[state] and the element currently below the read/write-head.
In such a case the procedure that emulates the Turing-machine halts by raising an exception.
The @italic{@element['tt "state"]}s and @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}s
can be arbitrary Racket values,
but usually symbols and exact integer numbers are the most convenient ones.
Using lists for @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}s
allows the simulation of multi-tape Turing-machines, although this may require many
@italic{@element['tt "rules"]}.
Procedure @rack[make-Turing-machine] is designed primarily for single tape Turing-machines.
Equivalence relation @rack[equal?] is used for comparison of two @italic{@element['tt "state"]}s
or two @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}s.
The @italic{@element['tt "state"]}s and @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}s
live in separate worlds. A @italic{@element['tt "state"]} never is compared to a
@italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]} or the @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}.
Hence the Turing-machine will not be confused when the intersection of the set of
@italic{@element['tt "state"]}s and the set of @italic{@element['tt "tape-symbol"]}s is not empty
or when a @italic{@element['tt "state"]} equals the @italic{@element['tt "dummy"]} or
an @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]}.
However, this may confuse a human reader when looking at the @italic{@element['tt "rules"]}
that describe the moves.
After reaching a @italic{@element['tt "final-state"]} the Turing-machine
returns its output as @rack[(append head tail)],
but without heading and trailing @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]} or
@italic{@element['tt "blank"]}s.
The output can contain @italic{@element['tt "blank"]}s but not at the start or the end.
The output never contains an @italic{@element['tt "empty-cell"]} or a
@italic{@element['tt "dummy"]}.

@note{The internal representation of the tape is such that each move is made in constant time,
independent of the size of the content of the tape and the position of the read/write-head.
The maximal time needed to prepare the output after reaching a @rack[final-state]
depends linearly on the size of the content.}

Procedure @rack[make-Turing-machine] returns a procedure that emulates a Turing-machine.
Before the Turing-machine procedure is produced
the arguments are checked to satisfy the following conditions,
equality to be understood in the sense of @rack[equal?].

@itemlist[
 @item{The @rack[blank], the @rack[empty-cell] and the @rack[dummy]
       must be distinct.}
 @item{The @rack[empty-cell] must not be used as a @rack[new-symbol].}
 @item{Each @rack[new-state] must appear as the @rack[old-state] of a @rack[rule]
       or must be one of the @rack[final-states].}
 @item{There must be at least one rule whose @rack[old-state] is the @rack[initial-state].}
 @item{The @rack[rules] must have distinct combinations @rack[(old-state old-symbol)].}
 @item{A @rack[move] must be @rack['R], @rack['L] or @rack['N].@(linebreak)
@rack[move] @rack['L] indicates that the read-write-head moves to the left
(or the tape to the right).@(linebreak)
@rack[move] @rack['R] indicates that the read-write-head moves to the right
(or the tape to the left).@(linebreak)
@rack[move] @rack['N] indicates that that the read-write-head (or the tape) does not move.}]

A rule of the form

@inset[@rack[((old-state old-symbol) (new-state new-symbol move))]]

where the @rack[old-symbol] is not the @rack[dummy]
applies when the @rack[old-state] equals the current @rack[state]
and the element currently under the read/write-head equals the @rack[old-symbol].
Such a @rack[rule] prevails over a rule with the same @rack[old-state] and
whose @rack[old-symbol] is the @rack[dummy].
A rule of the form

@inset[@rack[((old-state dummy) (new-state new-symbol move))]]

accepts every arbitrary element currently under the read/write-head.
A rule of the form

@inset[@rack[((old-state old-symbol) (new-state dummy move))]]

does not alter the element under the the read/write-head.
However, if the element is an @rack[empty-cell],
it is replaced by a @rack[blank].

@(elemtag "Turing-machine" "")
The procedure returned by @rack[make-Turing-machine],
say @elemref["Turing-machine" "Turing-machine"], is called as follows:

@defproc[#:kind "procedure" #:link-target? "Turing-machine"
(Turing-machine (input (listof tape-symbol)))
(values final-state output)]{
The @rack[output] shows the content of the tape after the machine has reached a
@rack[final-state], but without
heading or trailing @rack[blank]s or @rack[empty-cell]s.
If during the execution of the @elemref["Turing-machine" "Turing-machine"]
no rule can be found matching the current @rack[state] and the
element below the read/write-head, the @elemref["Turing-machine" "Turing-machine"]
halts by raising an exception.}

@defparam*[Turing-report on/off any/c boolean?]{
If @rack[on/off] is not @rack[#f], the new value is @rack[#t].
The initial value is @rack[#f].
When the value of parameter @rack[Turing-report] is true,
a @(elemref "Turing-machine" (element 'tt "Turing-machine")) reports each move
on the current output-port.
Each line of the report shows:

@itemlist[
@item{The move counter.}
@item{The old @rack[state].}
@item{The new @rack[state], possibly the same as the old @rack[state].}
@item{The @rack[tape-symbol] (or @rack[empty-cell]) encountered before replacing it.}
@item{The @rack[tape-symbol] that is written, possibly the same one as just read.}
@item{The move of the read/write-head (@rack['R], @rack['L] or @rack['N]).}
@item{The new position of the read/write-head and the new content of the tape shown as
the result of @rack[(list head tail)],
the first element of the @rack[tail] marking the new position of the read/write-head.}]

The report is best readable when the printed forms of @rack[state]s
do not vary much in their lengths.
The same holds for @rack[tape-symbol]s.}}]

@defparam*[Turing-limit n any/c (or/c #f exact-positive-integer?)]{
When the parameter holds an @rack[exact-positive-integer?], say n,
a @(elemref "Turing-machine" (element 'tt "Turing-machine"))
halts with an exception when it does not reach a final state within n or less moves.
The initial value is @rack[#f].
When @rack[n] is not an @rack[exact-positive-integer?],
the parameter is set to hold @rack[#f].} Example:

@interaction[
(require racket "make-Turing-machine.rkt")
(define rules
'(((1 _) (2 _ N))
  ((2 _) (3 _ N))
  ((3 _) (4 _ N))
  ((4 _) (T _ N))))

(Turing-limit 4)
(TM '())
(Turing-limit 3)
(TM '())]

@defparam*[Turing-move-width n exact-nonnegative-integer? exact-nonnegative-integer?]{
In a report the move counter is padded with spaces such as to take @rack[n] characters.
Move counts requiring more characters are not truncated.
The initial value is @rack[0].
For example, when expecting more than 9 but less than 100 moves,
use @rack[(Turing-move-width 2)] in order to produce a well alligned report
with all move-counts having the same number of characters.}

@section{Examples}

Some of the ideas used in the examples are based on material of Jay McCarthy
that can be found in @hyperlink["http://jeapostrophe.github.io/2013-10-29-tmadd-post.html"
                                "http://jeapostrophe.github.io/2013-10-29-tmadd-post.html"].

@subsection{Erase elements}
The following Turing-machine always halts.
A correct input is @tt["(x ... [+ x ...] ...)"],
where the square brackets indicate an optional part of the input.
The result of a correct input is the input without @tt["+"].
This is like addition of zero, one or more natural numbers,
where natural number n is written as `@tt["x ..."]' with n @tt["x"]s.
With a correct input the machine halts in state @tt["T"].
With incorrect input the machine halts in state @tt["F"].
The machine never moves left of the start of the input.
Letter @tt["E"] is the empty-cell,
@tt["B"] the blank and @tt["_"] the dummy.

@subsection{Binary addition}
The following Turing-machine adds two natural numbers written in binary notation.
The machine always terminates.
A correct input is defined as follows:

@inset{@verbatim[
"input   = (operand + operand)
operand = bit bit ...
bit     = 0 | 1"]}

An incorrect input yields state @element['tt "F"].
A correct input yields state @element['tt "T"] and output
@nonbreaking{@rack[(bit bit ...)]}
showing the sum of the two operands.
More precisely the output is @nonbreaking{@rack[(1 bit ...)]} or @rack[(0)],
id est, without leading zeros.
@element['tt "E"] is the empty-cell,
@element['tt "B"] the blank and @element['tt "_"] the dummy.
The initial content of the tape is modified such as to result in the sum.
In the sum a 0 bit is written as @element['tt "x"] and a 1 bit as @element['tt "y"].
During the addition the content of the tape is
@nonbreaking{@element['tt "(bit-0-or-1 ... x-or-y ... + bit-0-or-1 ...)"]}.
Bits of the second operand are processed starting from the least significant one.
Every such bit is replaced by a blank before it is processed.
The significance of the blanked bit is the same a that of
the right-most @nonbreaking{@element['tt "bit-0-or-1"]} of the first operand.
After all bits of the second operand have been processed,
the @element['tt "+"] is removed,
@element['tt "x"] and @element['tt "y"] are reverted to
@element['tt "0"] and @element['tt "1"] and leading zeros are removed.

@subsection{Decimal addition}
The following machine expects @nonbreaking{@element['tt "((n m) ...)"]} as input,
where each @element['tt "n"] and each @element['tt "m"] is an exact integer between 0 (inclusive)
and 10 (exclusive).
The machine adds the numbers @element['tt "n..."] and @element['tt "m..."] and returns the sum
@element['tt "s..."]
However the machine considers the first digit as the least significant one and
the last digit as the most significant one.
The machine does one pass through the input only.
During each step it moves to the right.
It replaces each input symbol @nonbreaking{@element['tt "(n m)"]} by one decimal digit.
State @element['tt "0"] indicates that there is no carry.
State @element['tt "1"] indicates that a carry must be added.
State @element['tt "0"] is the initial state and @element['tt "T"] the final state.
